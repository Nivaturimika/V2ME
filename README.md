# Random Access Mod

RAM is designed as a sandbox style mod. It contains little country specific flavour, but makes use of new techniques such as Dynamic Loc to create detailed event chains. This means while we may not have flavour events for a specific historical border arbitration or colonial dispute, any country can expect a detailed event chain if the appropriate conditions are met.

Currently in Indev development.
