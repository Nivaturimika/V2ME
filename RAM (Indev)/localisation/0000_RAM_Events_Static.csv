EVTDESC1000;\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to RAM.\n\nRAM is designed as a sandbox style mod. It contains little country specific flavour, but makes use of new techniques such as Dynamic Loc to create detailed event chains. This means while we may not have flavour events for a specific historical border arbitration or colonial dispute, any country can expect a detailed event chain if the appropriate conditions are met.\n\nWe highly encourage you to take a quick tour of some of RAM's new mechanics if you have not done so before.
