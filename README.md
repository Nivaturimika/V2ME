# Random Access Mod

A Victoria 2 Overhall, focused on dynamic mechanics and gameplay.

Currently indev. It is not considered playable.

For now the mod borrows heavily from GFM. Map, culture and core mechanics are likely to continue to draw heavily from GFM. Events, decisions and performance changes will be the focus of the mod.
